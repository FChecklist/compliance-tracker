# PROGRESS -- task-20260728-051733-owner-engine-phase-5-real-gaps

## Completed
- [x] Read AGENTS.md/CONSTITUTION.yaml/ACTIVE-CLAIMS.yaml governance chain, registered claim in ai-os/boss/ACTIVE-CLAIMS.yaml (commit 0b99c670, pushed)
- [x] Read phase_5_browser_execution_tiers scope from claude-control's VERIDIAN_ARCHITECTURE_V2_PHASE_PLAN_2026-07-25.yaml
- [x] Verified SPEC's cited PROJEXA prior art (src/lib/offline/work-progress-queue.ts, PR #54) does NOT exist anywhere in this repo's history -- `git log --all --diff-filter=A --name-only` zero matches, `gh pr view 54` is the unrelated VERI Reward engine. Built sync-engine.ts fresh instead of adapting a nonexistent file.
- [x] Real NPU inference: src/lib/browser-execution/npu-engine.ts -- reuses transformers-engine.ts's exact model (Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) via @huggingface/transformers' real `device: "webnn-npu"` execution provider (confirmed real in devices.d.ts's DEVICE_TYPES), gated by tier-orchestrator's new shouldAttemptNpu
- [x] Real Built-in AI inference: src/lib/browser-execution/builtin-ai-engine.ts -- real window.LanguageModel / window.ai.languageModel call path, gated by tier-orchestrator's new shouldAttemptBuiltinAi
- [x] tier-orchestrator.ts: added shouldAttemptNpu/shouldAttemptBuiltinAi gates (same pattern as existing shouldAttemptWebLlm) + tests in tier-orchestrator.test.ts
- [x] Cross-tier storage layer: src/lib/browser-execution/cross-tier-storage.ts -- real OPFS backend, real Cache API backend, IndexedDB backend that reuses (not replaces) model-cache.ts's IndexedDbModelCache; priority-ordered put/get/delete with real fallback chain
- [x] Browser-sync engine: src/lib/browser-execution/sync-engine.ts -- OfflineQueue with real same-entity coalescing (the "two queued offline changes to the same record" scenario), resolveConflict() for remote (server-side) conflicts, syncQueue() push pass, pullDeltaSync() delta sync, SyncMutex for concurrent-sync serialization
- [x] Full test suites for all 4 new files + orchestrator additions (npu-engine.test.ts, builtin-ai-engine.test.ts, cross-tier-storage.test.ts, sync-engine.test.ts)
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 needed -- repo-wide tsc is memory-heavy under this server's shared load)
- [x] `bun test src/lib/browser-execution` -- 108 pass, 0 fail

- [x] Registered litert-spike as a real entry (`litert_spike_browser_execution_prior_art`) in this repo's own ai-os/MASTER_INDEX.yaml `registries:` list (canonical_path_repo per that file's own header -- no cross-repo write needed) + regenerated the stale `quick_reference` block via ai-os/scripts/generate_quick_reference.py per that block's own protocol. `grep -q litert-spike ai-os/MASTER_INDEX.yaml` passes (phase_5's own success criterion).
- [x] ACTIVE-CLAIMS.yaml entry updated with STATUS UPDATE (implementation complete, PR opened) -- left in `active:` (not moved to `recently_completed:`) since the PR is not yet merged, per that file's own protocol #3

- [x] PR opened: https://github.com/FChecklist/compliance-tracker/pull/616 -- all real CI checks pass (Lint, Type Check, Build, Unit Tests, E2E Tests, Analyze, Guardrail Presence, Secret Scanning, Security Pattern, Terminology Guardrail, Doc Cross-Reference/Quarantine/Sentinel, Metadata Index Coverage, Asset Registry Coverage). `audit-check` correctly still fails (awaiting the mandatory human/auditor "AUDIT: PASS/FAIL" comment -- exactly the fresh supervisor audit this task's own EXPECTED_OUTPUT requires, not bypassed). `Vercel` failed on an unrelated deployment rate-limit, not a code issue.

## Remaining
- [ ] PR #616 needs a fresh supervisor audit before merge (this task does not self-merge per EXPECTED_OUTPUT)
- [ ] Once merged: move ai-os/boss/ACTIVE-CLAIMS.yaml entry from `active:` to `recently_completed:`
