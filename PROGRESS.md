# PROGRESS -- task-20260802-210700-pm-decision--fix-the-real-high-severity

Cites: `UMR-20260802-165606-4413` (OCID-020) throughout. `UMR-20260802-173631-ca85`
stays locked until this fix AND the rest of the real certification sweep are
independently verified complete.

## Completed
- [x] Read `ai-os/boss/ACTIVE-CLAIMS.yaml` + found the real prior finding this PM
      decision is about: OCID-020 redo session (PR #737) — Finding A, real
      `500` on `GET /api/departments` crashing the Compliance Register
      (`/compliance`) and Pendency View (`/compliance?status=overdue`) with a
      client-side `TypeError: z.map is not a function`.
- [x] Root-caused directly (not narrated): reproduced locally by building the
      exact same Drizzle relational query (`db.query.departments.findMany({with:
      {head, complianceItems, users}})`, verbatim from
      `src/app/api/departments/route.ts`) against the real `src/lib/db/schema.ts`
      via `drizzle-orm`. Real error reproduced: `There are multiple relations
      between "users" and "departments". Please specify relation name.`
- [x] Shipped a fix (`relationName: 'departmentMembers'`), opened PR #741,
      logged Finding B in `ai-os/MASTER-TRACKER.yaml`.
- [x] **On resume (invocation 2/20)**: discovered a genuinely parallel session
      independently root-caused and fixed the identical bug (same root cause,
      same fix shape) with additional defensive frontend handling and real
      regression tests, via PR #740 — which merged first (`c0df6f02` on
      `main`, independently re-verified via `git diff-tree -p c0df6f02 --
      src/lib/db/schema.ts`, not just trusted). This session's own duplicate
      PR #741 was correctly closed as superseded by that other session. Finding
      B (`GAP-ERP-CRM-403-NO-UX-EXPLANATION`) is likewise already merged into
      `ai-os/MASTER-TRACKER.yaml` via PR #742.
- [x] Rebased this session's branch onto `main` (`git rebase origin/main`,
      skipping the now-redundant duplicate schema-fix commit, resolving
      conflicts in `ai-os/boss/ACTIVE-CLAIMS.yaml` and this file to reflect
      current reality rather than keeping two stale/duplicate claim entries).
- [x] Confirmed on `main`: `src/lib/db/schema.ts` has
      `departmentsRelations.users: many(users, { relationName:
      'departmentMembers' })` and `usersRelations.department: one(departments,
      {..., relationName: 'departmentMembers' })`; `ai-os/MASTER-TRACKER.yaml`
      has `GAP-ERP-CRM-403-NO-UX-EXPLANATION` (single entry, no duplication).

## Remaining
- [ ] Independently retest the EXACT SAME real flow that crashed, against the
      real deployed app now that the fix is merged: sign in to
      `https://projexa-ai.com` (or whichever real live domain currently serves
      this app — re-verify per prior session's live finding that
      `projexa-ai.com` now serves compliance-tracker, not standalone PROJEXA),
      click "Register" / "Pendency View" (or `GET /compliance`,
      `GET /compliance?status=overdue` directly) — confirm no more
      "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred", confirm
      `GET /api/departments` returns real `200` with a real `{departments: [...]}`
      body, screenshot as evidence.
- [ ] After the fix is independently verified live: resume the broader real
      certification sweep per the PM spec — multi-tenant, multi-brand,
      first-time-onboarding, cache and search, remaining nav surface — reporting
      real incremental findings every cycle, not one final claim.
