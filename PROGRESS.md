# PROGRESS -- task-20260804-040805-register-ocid-057--universal-knowledge-g

## Completed
- [x] Read `ai-os/boss/ACTIVE-CLAIMS.yaml`, `ai-os/CONSTITUTION.yaml`/`AGENTS.md` governance context before starting
- [x] Verified the SPEC's claimed parent chain OCID-053..056 (+4 UMR IDs): does NOT exist anywhere in repo/branches/PRs -- flagged to Owner, same defect class as the already-flagged OCID-012 (re-confirmed still fake)
- [x] Confirmed real parent chain instead: OCID-020/021 -> ... -> OCID-052 (highest real OCID)
- [x] Built real Universal Knowledge Register/Graph/Dedup/Broken-Reference/Orphan report: `ai-os/VERIDIAN_OCID_057_UNIVERSAL_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_2026-08-04.md`
- [x] Cross-referenced (not re-derived) OCID-027's existing real catalogs (DATABASE_CATALOG.json/FUNCTION_CATALOG.json/AI_ROSTER_CATALOG.json/VCEL/prompt registry)
- [x] Registered 2 new gap entries in `ai-os/MASTER-TRACKER.yaml`: GAP-OCID-FABRICATED-PARENT-CHAIN-REFERENCES, GAP-KNOWLEDGE-NO-REPORT-BUSINESS-RULE-CATALOG
- [x] Added `ai-os/OS.yaml` index entry
- [x] Updated `ai-os/boss/ACTIVE-CLAIMS.yaml` (registered + closed same session, per protocol)
- [x] Validated all edited YAML files parse clean (`python3 -c "import yaml..."`)

## Remaining
- [ ] Open PR, let CI run, merge (no direct push to `main`)
