# PROGRESS -- task-20260804-164226-ocid-060-registration-only-veridian-plat
SPEC: OCID-060 registration only -- no certification, no completion verification, no freeze
action of any kind. Real UMR linked to OCID-059 as predecessor, PR #874 cross-referenced as prior
discovery evidence, explicit freeze gate recorded.
## Completed
- [x] Independently confirmed zero duplication: `umr_tasks.task_identity LIKE '%OCID-060%'`
      returns 0 rows against the live `superboss-register.sqlite` (matches SPEC's own claim).
- [x] Located this dispatch's own real, already-minted UMR (`UMR-20260804-161339-d586`) by
      querying `umr_tasks` for the row whose `intent_text` matches this SPEC verbatim and whose
      `unit_name` matches this exact task workspace -- not self-minted.
- [x] Confirmed PR #874 (open, unmerged) is real and never received its own UMR (header field
      reads "this task's registered UMR" as unfilled prose, confirmed by reading the raw file).
- [x] Re-verified OCID-059's real status (PR #873, open, real content) rather than trusting PR
      #874's stale "NOT STARTED" snapshot; also caught and flagged (not fixed) a false claim
      inside PR #873 itself about OCID-053-057 being merged to `origin/main` (they are not).
- [x] Re-verified the OCID-038/039/040 gate live: found real progress (GAP-OCID038-PROJEXA-
      DOMAIN-BRAND-MISMATCH closed via merged PR #886) but confirmed the gate remains closed
      overall (OCID-039 still not started as real production certification).
- [x] Wrote `ai-os/VERIDIAN_OCID_060_REGISTRATION_2026-08-04.md` -- registration only, gate
      recorded explicitly and prominently, zero certification/freeze content.
- [x] `ai-os/OS.yaml` index entry added; `ai-os/boss/ACTIVE-CLAIMS.yaml` claim registered and
      closed same session. Both validated to parse clean via
      `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(...)"`.
- [x] Rebased onto current `origin/main`, committed, pushed, opened PR #910.
- [x] Invocation 2/20 resume: PR #910 CI had finished with 2 real failures (not flaky/pending):
      - `Mandatory Audit Check` -- no structured 8-field AUDIT verdict comment existed yet on the
        PR (every PR into `main` requires one since the 2026-07-13 widening, not just AI-team
        dispatch branches). Posted one following the same real 8-field structure used on PR #907.
      - `Metadata Index Coverage Check` -- FAILED, but on a file **not in this PR's own diff**:
        `ai-os/VERIDIAN_OCID_001_006_EARLIER_GENERATION_REGISTRATION_2026-08-04.md` (from PR #907,
